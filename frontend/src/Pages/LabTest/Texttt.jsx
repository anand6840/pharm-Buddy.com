        <br />
        One of the most popular services PharmEasy offers is diagnostic testing.
        People need to book pathological tests for many reasons. But before
        booking, they wonder if the diagnostic centre can be trusted to produce
        accurate results and how long they might have to wait in a queue to get
        tested. <br />
        To bypass these hassles, PharmEasy has set up an extensive network of
        reputed pathological laboratories in India. One such lab is Thyrocare.
        With Thyrocare on board, we can give you access to a wide network of
        diagnostic laboratories.We also offer a home collection of samples as
        well. Bid adieu to anxious days of wondering where to book diagnostic
        tests and embrace the PharmEasy way. <br /> <br />
        <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Lab tests at your doorstep</span>
        <br />
        To ease your anxieties, PharmEasy offers the facility of doorstep
        collection. The technician will come to your house to collect samples.
        And all safety precautions are maintained. A fresh collection kit and/or
        needle will be used so that there is no contamination of samples of the
        spread of diseases. We use special ice boxes that meet NABL guidelines
        to transport your samples. The reports will be sent to you online. That
        means you won’t have to travel to the diagnostic lab to collect your
        reports. <br /> <br />
